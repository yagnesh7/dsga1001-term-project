# Satirical News Classification

With the growing amount of fake news circulating on the internet, the ability to differentiate between real and satirical information becomes crucial. Our group obtained both real and satirical news headlines by either downloading pre-existing datasets from Kaggle, or web scraping from news sites such as the Atlantic and Fox News, as well as satirical websites, including the Onion. We built several machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forest, and neural network to classify whether an article headline was satirical or not. The metrics used to evaluate model performances, such as the AUC, demonstrate that our model indeed has some capacity in distinguishing between authentic and satirical news headlines, although future work is needed to further polish our model and obtain more accurate predictions.
